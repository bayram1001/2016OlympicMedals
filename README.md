# 2016OlympicMedals

GOALS:
  Create a new maven project: 2016OlympicsMedals and add necessary libraries. Automate the following scenarios as a team. It is up to you how you design the classes and methods.
Push your project to GitHub.
* Test Case 1: SORT TEST
  1. Go to website https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2016_Summer_Olympics#Medal_table.
  2. Verify that by default the Medal table is sorted by rank. To do that you need to capture all the cells in the Rank column and check if they are in ascending order (highlighted in the picture). Use TestNG assertions.
  3. Click link NOC.
  4. Now verify that the table is now sorted by the country names. To do that you need to capture all the names in the NOC column and check if they are in ascending/alphabetical order (highlighted in the picture). Use TestNG assertions.
  5. Verify that Rank column is not in ascending order anymore. Use TestNG assertions.
* Test Case 2: THE MOST
  1. Go to website https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2016_Summer_Olympics.
  2. Write a method that returns the name of the country with the most number of gold medals.
  3. Write a method that returns the name of the country with the most number of silver medals.
  4. Write a method that returns the name of the country with the most number of bronze medals.
  5. Write a method that returns the name of the country with the most number of medals.
  6. Write TestNG test for your methods.
* Test Case 3: COUNTRY BY MEDAL
  1. Go to website https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2016_Summer_Olympics.
  2. Write a method that returns a list of countries whose silver medal count is equal to 18.
  3. Write TestNG test for your method.
* Test Case 4: GET INDEX
  1. Go to website https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2016_Summer_Olympics.
  2. Write a method that takes country name and returns the row and column number. You decide the datatype of the return.
  3. Write TestNG test for your method (use Japan as test input).
* Test Case 5: GET SUM
  1. Go to website https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2016_Summer_Olympics.
  2. Write a method that returns a list of two countries whose sum of bronze medals is 18.
  3. Write TestNG test for your method.
